<h2 class="blue-text text-darken-4">Predictive Healthcare Speaker Series</h2>
<h4>Sharing lessons and perspectives on successfully implementing and integrating predictive healthcare solutions</h4>

<p>
  As interest in applying the tools of data science to clinical and operational healthcare problems increases, the success of the solutions will depend on much more than the performance of a particular algorithm. 
</p>
  The Penn Medicine Predictive Healthcare speaker series aims to bring together a wide array of players from across the institution who have a stake in the successful operationalization of data science solutions in health care. The topics will encompass separate disciplines that come together to deliver these solutions, including:

<li>Computer science</li>
<li>AI/machine learning</li>
<li>Human factors and human computer interaction</li>
<li>Real-time and big data architectures</li>
<li>Process improvement</li>
<li>Clinical/medical research</li>


<p>
  We hope that this speaker series and discussion forum will foster collaboration and an exchange of ideas to deliver effective predictive solutions in healthcare.

The ability to dynamically optimize staffing is crucial to an efficient Emergency Department; the COVID19 pandemic has highlighted even more clearly the need for agile responses to rapidly changing circumstances.   We will present a digital simulation that enables ED Operations Leadership to model multiple variables rapidly and predict changes to key ED metrics based on variations in productivity and throughput.
